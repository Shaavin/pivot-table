        Click on a column header button (ðŸ‘Š) to aggregate data by the column.
        Click on additional column header buttons to continue aggregating data

        For instance, clicking on "Item" will group and display results by item
        type. Then, clicking on "Region" will sub-group data by region for each
        item. Further yet clicking "Employee" will show aggregated results for
        each item, per region, and then for each employee.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each aggregated group, you can click to expand the group to see the
        subgroups that it's comprised of.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also click on the text of a column header to sort the table by
        that value. For instance, clicking on the "Region" will alphabetize the
        results by region name.
